Elevator Simulation with GUI ðŸš€

This repository contains a Python-based Elevator Simulation application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The program dynamically simulates elevator movements in a multi-floor building, visualizing their positions and handling user-defined elevator calls.

Key Features ðŸŒŸ
Dynamic Elevator Control:
Simulates the movement of multiple elevators to efficiently serve user requests.
Uses a proximity-based algorithm to minimize elevator travel time.
Interactive Visualization:
Displays elevator positions and floor layouts on a user-friendly canvas.
Step-by-step navigation through the simulation process.
User Input Integration:
Lets users define:
Number of floors in the building.
Elevator calls for specific floors.
Simulation Playback:
Navigate through the simulation with Next and Previous buttons.
Watch elevators move in real-time as they serve user requests.
Separate Control Window:
Provides a dedicated interface for navigating the simulation.

Example Usage ðŸ‘‡
Input Number of Floors: Define how many floors the building has.
Elevator Calls: Specify the floors where the elevators are called.
Visualize Movement: Watch the elevators move step-by-step as they serve the requests.
Navigate Steps: Use the Next and Previous buttons to view all positions.
